          I began working of this project as a UI Developer, implementing features and UIs, using <mark>C++</mark> and <mark>WPF</mark> (with the NoesisGUI layer for the interface).
          Later on the project, I swapped roles to become a Technical UI designer, helping iterations for faster for the designs and prototypes, and making the link between the teams thanks to my knowledge of the code base.

            After being noticed on my work and my method on one of the main features I implemented for Baldur's Gate III, I joined the UI/UX Design department as a Technical UI Designer, putting my knowledge from the code side and supporting fellow designers with this knowledge, helping with estimations and what needs to be done, while learning the ropes about UI and UX design.

          During my time of my Master's Degree, I specialized my computer science skills into Graphics, Image Processing and Video Games development, learning mostly to manage small projects and working as a team with deadlines.
          
          Outside the university, I spent most of my free time attending to the MUUG (Montpellier Unity User Group) to attend monthly talks related to video games, and participating to any game jam I could, creating my bases for the video game industry and having a little knowledge in most of the fields that the video game industry cover, facilitating communicaiton.

          During my time in Scotland, I learned how to handle projects and team working, as well improving my english and my communitcation skills.
          
          Outside the university, I spent most of my free time visiting Scotland, learning a new culture and discovering the world from another perspective. But mostly, spending time at the comic shop, practicing my English and playing Dungeons & Dragons, making me think, tell stories and working with a group to achieve our goals.
